# Project 1 Documentation

For this website, I intentionally kept the design simple. Something I really wanted to focus on was understanding how image resizing works, especially while creating GIFs using piskelapp.com.

In the past, I often noticed that my GIFs appeared distorted when added to a webpage. At first, I assumed there was something wrong with the files themselves, but I later realized it was purely a resizing issue. One of the most useful takeaways from the last class was learning that it is always smarter to resize images before incorporating them into a website rather than trying to resize them while coding.

With that in mind, I adjusted my workflow and prepared my images at the correct dimensions beforehand. This made the integration much smoother and helped preserve the quality of the visuals.

For the structure of the site, I used basic HTML concepts that we went over in class. After setting up the foundation, I experimented with animating the heading on hover, which was a fun way to introduce some interactivity while still keeping the overall design minimal.

Overall, this project helped me better understand the relationship between preparation and implementation, specifically how small decisions, like properly sizing assets ahead of time, can significantly improve the final result.
